             <p>My name is Kelsey Flanery, and I am a young professional in the Fargo Moorhead community. I have experience in social and digital media, and I have a passion for effective communication.



I am pursuing a degree in Strategic Communications at North Dakota State University with a minor in Art focusing in Graphic Design. My studies have helped me understand advertising, public relations, brand promotion as well as writing and design for digital and print media.



I completed an internship as a digital and social media specialist for a local fine jewelry retailer. This internship provided me with experience with social media for business such as Facebook Ads Manager, Instagram Analytics, and Wordpress for Business.
